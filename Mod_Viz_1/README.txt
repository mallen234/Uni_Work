Inputs: checkpoint3_CH.py + N + phi0 + timesteps.
It will output the free energy at the end and visualise, to quit the visualisation just ctrl+c on the terminal.

2 : checkpoint3_Electric.py
Inputs: checkpoint3_Electric.py + N + tolerance + Method( just type "j" or "g" for jacobi or gauss seidel)

3 : checkpoint3_Magnetic.py
Inputs: checkpoint3_Electric.py + N + tolerance + Method(just type "j" or "g" for jacobi or gauss seidel)

In order to run the SOR method you must use checkpoint3_Electric.py but change the command line arguments.
Inputs for SOR: checkpoint3_Electric.py + "SOR" + N + tolerance
